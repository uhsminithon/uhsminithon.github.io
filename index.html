          In the United States, more children die from pediatric cancer than any other disease.  An estimated 16,000 children will be diagnosed with cancer this year, and approximately 1 in 5 will not survive.  The Urbana High School Mini-THON organization (UHS Mini-THON) exists to help change this.  Through passionate fundraising and engaging community events, our student-run organization aims to help fight childhood cancer!  Through the Four Diamonds Fund (www.fourdiamonds.org) and in association with the Penn State University THON (http://thon.org/), the UHS Mini-THON hopes to help conquer cancer by assisting children treated at Penn State Children's Hospital and their families through superior care, comprehensive support and innovative research. We help the Four Diamonds Fund to cover all expenses for the care and treatment of the child not paid for by insurance or other means.
