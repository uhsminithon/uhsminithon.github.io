          The Urbana High School Mini-THON Organization is the largest student-run organization in Frederick County, MD.  With over 400 official members, the UHS Mini-THON raises money each year for pediatric cancer research and for the Four Diamonds Fund.  Just as the Penn State University THON and our many sister Mini-THON programs, our assistance to the <a href="https://fourdiamonds.org">Four Diamonds Fund</a> allows it to pay for any and all medical bills and/or expenses that insurance will not cover for families of children battling pediatric cancer.  Started in 2014 by a handful of passionate Urbana students, we are proud to say that, as of 2017, our organization had cumulatively raised over $115,000 for the kids!

           Though most of our money comes in from our many community events —such as our Color Run, Silent Auction, Mini-THON Night, and various Spirit Nights— we encourage all of our members and their supporters to use <a href="https://fourdiamonds.donordrive.com/">Donor Drive</a> to help us reach our goal! <br><br/>
           
	We would like to thank all of our supporters for graciously supporting us in our mission to conquer childhood cancer —without your help, none of all the good that we do would be possible.
